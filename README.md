NitinSample
===========

This is a simple project to view private photos.
You need to login to view them.

Right now its setup with just 1 user by default called 'demo' 
So you can use 
email: demo
password: demo

Note that password is stored as sha1 in the persistence store.

Also note that the view is optimised only for iPhone 4" screen and works only in Portrait mode.


I have used a few categories created on UIImage
